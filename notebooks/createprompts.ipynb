      "\n",
      "**Advisor:** That’s a good start! How much do you have saved up so far, and what’s your target for the house deposit?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Client:** I have about €15,000 saved, and I’m looking to save around €30,000 in the next 3 to 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Advisor:** That’s a solid plan. Given your high risk tolerance, we might explore some investment options that could potentially provide higher returns. Are you open to diversifying beyond tech stocks?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Client:** Yes, I’m definitely open to that. What kind of investments do you suggest?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Advisor:** We can look into index funds or ETFs that track broader markets, which offer a good balance of risk and potential returns. Additionally, consider exploring real estate investment trusts (REITs) as they can be a way to invest indirectly in property.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Client:** That sounds interesting! How much of my savings should I allocate to these investments compared to my savings account?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Advisor:** A general guideline could be to keep 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses in your savings account for emergencies and allocate the rest towards investments. You could start with a 70/30 split, investing 70% and keeping 30% in savings.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Client:** That makes sense. How often should I review these investments?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Advisor:** It’s a good idea to review your portfolio every 6 to 12 months, but also keep an eye on market trends. If you find a significant change in your financial situation or goals, consider adjusting your investment strategy accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Client:** I appreciate this advice! I feel like I have a clearer path now. \n",

      "**Advisor:** I’m glad to hear that! If you have any further questions or need help implementing this strategy, don’t hesitate to reach out.\n",
